## Expo Go Native Module Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Expo Go inconsistently fails to load native modules from project dependencies.  The problem manifests as cryptic errors during testing, even when the modules appear correctly installed. The root cause seems to be a mismatch or incompatibility between the Expo Go environment and the native module's requirements. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `expo install ...`
3. Run the app using `expo start`. 
4. Test on Expo Go. The problem is intermittent; you may need to try several times to see the error.

### Workaround

Use EAS Build for a production build. The native modules load reliably when run outside the Expo Go environment.

### Additional Notes

The exact behavior might vary depending on the native module used and the Expo SDK version.  Detailed logs during development will aid in debugging this kind of issue.
