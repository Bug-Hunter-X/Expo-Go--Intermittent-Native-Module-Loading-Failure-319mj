This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a library which depends on a native module.  The error message might be cryptic, such as a general native module error or a missing dependency error, even if the native module is correctly installed. This happens because Expo Go has its own environment and doesn't always correctly load or link native modules from the project's dependencies, especially if those dependencies are not directly managed by Expo.
